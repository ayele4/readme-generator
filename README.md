# Readme-generator

# Description
The project for the week was to create a backend application that generates a professional readme. This assignment gave a lot of insight on how to use the command line for an application. There were a few hurdles to get over, such as running the application repeatedly to make sure the correct data was going through. Testing the application proved to be a little more tedius because it was neccessary to go through all the prompts to be sure it was functioning properly.
